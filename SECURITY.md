# Security Policy

Thank you for taking time reading the following information carefully. Your contribution is highly welcomed!

## Supported Versions

Only the **latest stable release** is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I highly encourage you to follow the principles of a responsible disclosure:

* Do not publish your research before contacting me first.
* [Write me an e-mail](mailto:wheredoihaveanaccount@timokuehne.com)
* Do not open a public issue until my confirmation.
* If the vulnerability is accepted please give me at least 4 weeks to release proper security updates.
* After the security updates are released feel free to publish your research.

**Note**: This is a private side-project, maintained in my spare time. Therefore, I can't promise to answer you within three days but I try to respond within 3-5 days.

Thank you.
